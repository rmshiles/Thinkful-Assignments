    "To complete this assignment, submit a link to a Jupyter notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to model the result of a coin toss. In your model, include any features that you think important in explaining the result. Discuss with your mentor about the pros and cons of adding too many features into your model.\n",
    "2. If you ever used Netflix, you should already have realized that it provides some recommendations for you to watch. In data science, this is an example of the so-called **recommendations systems**. Read this nontechnical blog post of [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639) about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model. \n",

    "### Major Features-\n",
    "- the torsional force applied to the coin when it leaves the hand \n",
    "- the uniformity of density in the coin \n",
    "- the shape and size of the coin\n",
    "- how high the coin was flipped\n",
    "- the material the coin was made of \n",
    "- the material surface the coin landed on \n",
    "- the leveness of the surface the coin landed on \n",
    "- the force normal of the coin the flipping device(hand) and the surface it lands on\n",
    "- the gravity acting on that coin(if we are to consider other planets or even certain parts of the earth )  \n",
    "### Minor features\n",
    "- the density of the atmosphere where the coin was fliped\n",
    "- if the coin has any magnetic properties how they may have been influenced by EMF\n",
    "- the flexability of the coins metal\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that a lot of these features can be ignored if we can assume certain conditions to be normally distributed over a small range such as if we are flipping a coin in one spot on a perfectly level surface and the coins density is evenly distributed and the shape is even with out bumps or ridges. we could even take it a step further by having a robot flip the coin in such a precise way applying a specific amount of torsional force and applied force. even with this there are still variables that may com into play but are highly unlikely. \n",
